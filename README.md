I am accepting the 30 Days productivity challenge of my codeChef Club . So as to learn and be productive for the next 30 days. And I am accepting this challenge so as to make my self cosistance with the code and be productive for the next 30 days. As we know that Consistancy with hard work beat talent .

I will update my daily logs here so anyone can verify it anytime and the rules for this challenge is written here according to this rule I will take this challenge forward. Maintaing logs keep myself productive and motovated to take this forward.

# 30 days of productivity works as follow:

1. Individual has to work continuously without breaking their work-streak for 30 days.

2. Individual has to figure out one coding domain and start working towards it, it can be competitive programming, learning any language, web development, machine learning, AIML. UI/UX can also be taken into account.

3. Individual has to maintain less or no social activeness, screen time over Snapchat, Instagram etc needs to be reduced to max to max 30mins a day (collectively).

4. Individual has to post about his daily work at the end of the day on Twitter with the hashtag- #30Daysofproductivity.

5. It works similarly to Snapchat streaks , if you went out more than 2 days of unproductiveness, you’ll have to start it again from day1.

6. Sundays can be taken as rest days or half days, those who even want to work can feel free to work on Sundays as well.

7. This officially starts from 27th of March 2023. Before 27th figure out which thing, which field of interest you’ll be working in.

8. You can check my daily logs here :-  logs.md
